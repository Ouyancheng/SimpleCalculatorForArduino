CMPUT 274 Project 
Project Tile: Simple Calculator on Arduino
Group Member: Yancheng Ou, Yun Cao

Description: 
In this project, we are going to implement a simple calculator on Arduino, using the ILI9341 touchscreen as the I/O device. 
A GUI will be implemented on the touchscreen and the users can type expressions by touching the screen. 
This calculator will support evaluating simple expressions like this: 
    1.1+2*3+(4+5/6*(7-8*9)), 
and hopefully we can make more than just evaluating this kind of simple expression. 
We might add support to some unary operators, such as sin(x), cos(x) and so forth. 
For simplicity, all digits are floating point numbers, but it's not yet settled down. 
We might add support to integers if we have enough time.  

Also we might add support for functions and variables, but they are making the parser more complicated. 

Milestones: 
1. ... To Nov. 16: 
Build a simple GUI -- a keybord and the upper space is reserved for displaying expressions and results. 

2. ... To Nov. 20: 
Build the lexer, which evalates the whole expression the user typed and split it into tokens. 
Tokens are obtained by calling the function getNextToken(), which will evaluate and split the next token. 

3. ... To Nov. 30: 
Build the parser, this is not a trivial part. 
We will evaluate a variety of algorithms and choose the best one. 
The algorithms will vary from Recursive Descent (LL(1)), Shunting Yard Algorithm (converting the expressing to RPN) or other LR algorighms. 
Only one of the algorithms will be used. 

4. Bonus 
Add support for variables and unary operators. 
Unary operators will include some common functions such as sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) and log10(x). 
In this part, we will implement a symbol table. 

5. Extra Bonus
Add support for user-defined functions. 
This is another non-trivial part. 
Addition modules might be added to support this feature.
